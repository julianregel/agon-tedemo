# Agon Tile Engine Demo

This repo contains some very simple BBC BASIC programs that use the Agon Light Tile Engine.

To run, copy the contents of the files to your Agon Light's SD card, ideally into a directory (e.g., TEDEMO) and then run the TEDEMO.BAS (which is simply a loader for the demo programs themselves).

For example:

```
*CD TEDEMO
CHAIN "TEDEMO.BAS"
```
